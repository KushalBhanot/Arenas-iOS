# Arenas-iOS

This is a basic multi-screen drawing application.
- Red Arena is for red squares
- Blue Arena is for blue squares
- Magical Arena well, is for magical shapes

Classes Used:
- UIButton
- UINavigationController
- UIView
- UIViewController

Made this app to strengthen my concepts of NavigationController and also, toyed around different variations of the code.
