# Arenas-iOS

This is a basic multi-screen drawing application.
- Red Arena is for red squares
- Blue Arena is for blue circles
- Magical Arena well, is for magical colors
- Names of the buttons on the home screen are editable on their respective views(delegation)

Classes Used:
- UIButton 
- UILabel
- UINavigationBar
- UINavigationController
- UITextField
- UIView
- UIViewController


Made this app to strengthen my concepts of NavigationController, Delegation, NavigationBar and also, toyed around different variations of the code.
